    Did you know that there is also an **IGV web application** that runs only in a web browser, does not use Java, and requires no downloads? See **[https://igv.org/app](https://igv.org/app)**. Click on the Help menu in the app for more information about using IGV-Web.

# Latest release of IGV Desktop: 2.19.1

!!! Danger "As of version 2.19.0, IGV requires **Java 21 or greater**. "
    If you download one of the IGV versions that does not include Java, make sure you have Java 21 installed and in your path.

!!! note "Linux users:"
    The 'IGV for Linux' download includes AdoptOpenJDK (now Eclipse Temurin) version 21 for x64 Linux. See their list of supported platforms [here](https://adoptium.net/supported-platforms/). If your platform is not on the "x64 Linux" list, or the packaged Java does not work on your version of Linux, download the 'Command line IGV for all platforms' and use it with your own Java installation.
