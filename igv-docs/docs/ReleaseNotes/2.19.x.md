**New features**

* New option to download the sequence and/or annotations to local storage when selecting hosted reference genomes. Currently, the default is to use them remotely. For genomes that support downloading, radio buttons will be presented to choose downloading and using the local files instead. The files will be downloaded to the `igv/genomes` folder, which is usually located in the user home folder.

* New options to load ENCODE production release data from the `File` menu.
