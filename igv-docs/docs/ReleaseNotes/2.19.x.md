# IGV 2.19.1 - December 2024

!!! Danger "As of version 2.19.1, IGV requires **Java 21 or greater**." 
    If you download one of the IGV versions that does not include Java, make sure you have Java 21 installed and in your path.
    
!!! Danger "As of version 2.19.1, IGV Mac apps require **MacOS 11 (Big Sur)** or greater." 
    For older MacOS versions, either use the *"Command line IGV for all platforms"* -or- download a Mac app for IGV 2.18.4 or earlier. All older IGV versions are available in the [**Archive**](https://data.broadinstitute.org/igv/projects/downloads/).
    
    
**New features**

* New option to download the sequence and/or annotations to local storage when selecting hosted reference genomes. Currently, the default is to use them remotely. For genomes that support downloading, radio buttons will be presented to choose downloading and using the local files instead. The files will be downloaded to the `igv/genomes` folder, which is usually located in the user home folder.

* New options to load ENCODE production release data from the `File` menu.

**Bug fixes**

* Copy read details broken. [Github issue #1604](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1604)

* Chromosome aliasing does not work for genbank files. [Github issue #1573](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1573)
